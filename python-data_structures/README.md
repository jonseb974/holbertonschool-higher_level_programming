## Getting Started


### 0. Print a list of integers
	mandatory
	Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

		* Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
	* Format: one integer per line. See example
	* You are not allowed to import any module
	* You can assume that the list only contains integers
	* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
	* You have to use str.format() to print integers
```

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print_list_integer(my_list)
